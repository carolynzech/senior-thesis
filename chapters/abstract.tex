\chapter*{Abstract}

%
Software providers handling sensitive data must verify that their applications conform to a wide breadth of \policies.
%
For example, to comply with the GDPR, applications must delete a user's personal data on request.
% 
Existing tools to express \policies{} are either inexpressive or overly technical.
%
\syslang{} is a new \policylang{} that can specify a wide range of \policies{} in an intuitive, 
controlled natural language format.
%
\Devs{} compile their \syslang{} policies to Rust programs,
which they can then run against their applications to verify compliance.
%
We evaluate \syslang{} on seven real-world Rust applications and find that it can
express a wide variety of \policies{}, 
it incurs low \dev{} effort,
and that it is executes quickly enough for use in a production setting.
