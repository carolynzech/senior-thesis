\section*{Abstract}

%
Software providers handling sensitive data must verify that their applications conform to a wide breadth of \policies.
%
For example, to comply with the GDPR, providers must check that their applications contain logic to delete all of a user's personal data.
% 
Existing tools to express \policies{} are either expressive but overly technical, or are nontechnical but also not expressive.
%
\syslang{} is a new \policylang{} that is both expressive and accessible to nontechnical stakeholders.
%
\syslang{} can specify a wide range of \policies{} in an intuitive, natural language format.
%
Our \syslang{} compiler outputs graph queries over a program dependence graph (PDG),
which developers can then run against their applications to verify compliance.
%
We evaluate \syslang{} on seven real-world Rust applications and find that it is
sufficiently expressive, precise, and efficient.
