\section{Compiler}

Next, the \syslang{} compiler translates policies into graph queries over \sys{}'s PDG,
which \devs{} can then check against their application.
%
The compiler first parses the policy into an abstract syntax tree (AST).
%
It then traverses this AST to verify that the policy is properly scoped.
%
It errors if any variables are used in a relation without first being introduced by an iterator or definition.
%
It also prevents duplicate introductions of the same variable in a single scope.

Once the compiler verifies that the policy is properly scoped,
it performs a second pass over the AST to compile it to Rust code.
%
It performs compilation via template expansion.
%
It identifies the relevant template for each node in the AST,
substituting in the policy's variables and markers.
%
The |and|, |or|, |for each|, |there is|, and |if| constructs correspond to Rust builtin operators.
%
The remainder of the expressions compile to operations using \sys{}'s Graph Query API.
%
This API offers functions for common operations over the PDG.
%
For example, the ``goes to'' relation corresponds to the |flows_to| \sys{} API function.
%
The compiler also outputs boilerplate code to run \sys{} against the policy.
