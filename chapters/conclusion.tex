\chapter{Conclusion}

\syslang{} is a \policylang{} that is accessible, expressive, and precise.
%
\Ces{} can express high-level policies about flows between marked entities in an application,
without requiring in-depth knowledge of the underlying PDG or application source code.

Our evaluation demonstrates that \syslang is expressive enough to represent a variety of real-world privacy policies,
that its compiler outputs correct, precise, and performant policies.
