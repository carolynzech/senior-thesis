\section{Limitations}
This prototype has some limitations which could be overcome with further engineering effort.
%
We detail those below.

\subsection{Direct Dependencies}
\label{sec:direct-limits}
\syslang{} predicates reason about \emph{transitive} dependencies between PDG nodes.
%
There is no way for \ces{} to enforce a \emph{direct} edge between two nodes.
%
In most cases, transitive dependencies are the correct level of abstraction.
%
For example, given the Rust code \lstinline[language=Rust]|sink(*sensitive)|,
one might reasonably conclude that |sensitive| goes to |sink|.
%
However, since |sensitive| is dereferenced, the PDG contains an intermediate node between |sensitive| and |sink|,
so there is no direct data flow edge between |sensitive| and |sink|.
%
However, it is possible that a \dev{} would want to forbid any intermediate data transformations
to sensitive data before it reaches some |sink| (perhaps in a security-critical setting).
%
\syslang{} cannot express this policy, while \sys{}'s Graph Query API can.

\subsection{Code Improvements}
\label{sec:code-limits}
The \syslang{} compiler currently lacks optimization passes, so it misses opportunities for efficiency improvements.
%
For example, if a policy contains two quantifiers over the same data, the \syslang{} compiled policy will traverse the PDG twice,
when it could have just done one traversal and stored the result for the subsequent iteration.

The Graph Query API also has a sophisticated error message framework,
which allows \devs{} to print which source code locations are causing policy failure.
%
\syslang{}'s policies currently only print whether the policy was successful,
but the compiler's templates could be revised to support this error message framework.
%

\subsection{Other Limitations}
\label{sec:other-limits}
Our \syslang{} prototype supports five levels of numbered clauses, but more could be added with additional engineering effort.
%
The prototype also only supports iterating over defined variables and variables marked \lstinline[language=CNL]|@@m@@|.
%
If \syslang{} allowed filtering on predicates, e.g. \lstinline[language=CNL]|For each "x" that goes to "y"|,
its policies would be more concise.
